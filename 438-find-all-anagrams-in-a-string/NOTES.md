1.Sliding window technique :
Ex: abcb  ( window ab)
First window : phash= 1 1 0 ..  shash =1 1 0 .... result : 0
Second window : remove left value(a) |  shash 0 1 0...
take right value (c) Â  |  shash 0 1 1...
* Initialize phash,shash with 26 characters array len
* Window is the p length
* For the first window
* Calculate frequency of each character in String "p" (window) in phash
* Calculate frequency of each character in String "s" (window) in shash First window
* After first window , Compare shash and phash if equal add index to result
* Take next right element  and remove left element from string s
2.Recursion Window Technique :
* Find all anagrams for the given string p using recursion method
* Take all anagrams and check each anagram present in String s,if present add index to result

Recursion Method : 

*   Find all anagrams for given String p 
*   Take one by one anagram and check in String s , if found add index to result 

Recursion Tree : To find anagrams  
                abc                         
            a       b       c           
        b     c    a  c    a  b
      c        b   c   a   b   a
      
        abc,acb,bac,bca,cab,cba     
                    abab
                a   b   a   b 
               b    a   b   a
